2. Answer following questions:


1. Why do we need machine learning methods instead of creating a complicated formula?

Ans: Because it is often very difficult to creat a function on hand.




2. Wha't's the disadvantages of the 1st Random Choosen methods in our course?

Ans: It did not have a direction, so it was not sufficient.


3. Is the 2nd method supervised direction better than 1st one? What's the disadvantages of the 2nd supversied directin method?

Ans: Yes, it was besser than the first one. 
     It does not work, or it is very insufficient, if we have more than two or three variables. 





4. Why do we use Derivative / Gredient to fit a target function?

Ans:Because the function is often very complicated, it is fast impossible to caculate the minimum or maximum of the function directly.




5. In the words 'Gredient Descent', what's the Gredient and what's the Descent?

Ans: Gredient is the first order, descent is the step one takes to find the local minimum or maximum.




6. What's the advantages of the 3rd gradient descent method compared to the previous methods?

Ans: It can handle multi variables. 





7. Using the simple words to describe: What's the machine learning.

Ans: we use this method to find a function that can describe the data.
